8-1 Journal: Reflection

Interpreting user needs is a process that is best completed by communicating with the various stakeholders, and implementing them into a program requires a thorough understanding of the system involved. User stories help with both because they transmit the requirements into a form that the Developer can clearly understand and easily follow as a step-by-step guide. In the past, I usually developed programs by forming a general plan and completing it in a linear fashion. From this course, I learned it is not an ideal way to approach developing them, though, and I intend to incorporate the Agile processes of incremental development, estimation, and collaboration whenever possible in my future work. Being a good team member in software development means taking responsibility for the program, adapting efficiently, maintaining accuracy, and communicating effectively.
